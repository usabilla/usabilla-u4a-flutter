    # When depending on this package from a real application you should use:
    #   flutter_usabilla: ^x.y.z
    # See https://dart.dev/tools/pub/dependencies#version-constraints
    # The example app is bundled with the plugin so we use a path dependency on
    # the parent directory to use the current plugin's version.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/footer.png
    - assets/images/background.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: MiloOT
      fonts:
      - asset: assets/fonts/MiloOT-Text.otf
    - family: MiloOT-Bold
      fonts:
      - asset: assets/fonts/MiloOT-Bold.otf
    - family: MiloOT-Medi
      fonts:
      - asset: assets/fonts/MiloOT-Medi.otf
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
